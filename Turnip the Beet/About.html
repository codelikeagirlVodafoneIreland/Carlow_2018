  <p><h1>-Turnip-</h1></p>
  <p><h3>I developed my love of healthy food in my early teens.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>My face became riddled with spots. <h3></p>
  <p><h3>I desperatly looked for a cure. <h3></p>
  <p><h3>It was my doctor who suggested taking a look at my diet.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>I changed my diet completley substituting my fatty processed foods for leafy greens and lean proteins.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>My face immediately cleared up and I havent looked back since.<h3></p>

  <p><h1>-Beet-</h1></p>
  <p><h3>I have been a dancer my whole life.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>My life has revolved around diets from a very early aged.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>Throughout my life i have tried all the dieting fads there are in attempt to keep up with the other dancers.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>However i was always hungry and lacking energy.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>It wasnt until i was about 16 that I realised that I can live a healthy lifestyle and stay slim while eating tasty food and being full.<h3></p>
  <p><h3>I began experimenting with fruits and vegetables and stopped counting my calories. <h3></p>
  <p><h3>Now I'm full of energy, eat a wholesome diet and I am still able to meet the weight standards for dancing.<h3></p>
