    -Why We Love Veggies-

  <div class="content5"><!-- This is the text under the above header-->
    We started this blog to share our love of healthy food with the world. Many people have a misconception
    about healthy food. they think that it will leave them hungry and not taste as good as other, less
    nutritious foods. We believe that plant based dishes and healthy food can be just as tasty and filling. We
    use veggies, fruits and nuts to replace processed foods in meals,creating healthy dishes that are tasty
    and affordable not to mention the many, many healthy benefits they provide. Plus, they are really fun!

<div class="content7"><!--this is the second part of text-->
  We were inspired by the natural beauty of the rainbow.
  It represents a balance of dark and light, something that we wanted to replicate in our diets.
  We started with fruits and vegetables as we felt it was the simplest way to "eat the rainbow".
  All our recipes are based on the natural goodness of fruits and vegetables.
  From our humble beginnings growing turnips, we gradually introduced more and more flavour to create a diet that was delicious, nutricious and good for the soul.
  It's time to Turnip the Beet!
