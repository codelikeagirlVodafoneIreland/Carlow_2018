  <p>To see the Kimberley region in Western Australia usually involves five-star cruising and a five-figure price tag – we decided to see if we could experience this wilderness on a small budget…</p>

  <p>"Slight problem – it appears the hull has split.” The woman on the phone said this in an unemotional and matter-of-fact manner, as though she’d told me my train was five minutes late. Though I’m no master sailor, I knew enough to know that this was not good news.</p>

  <p>The small city of Broome, on the far west coast of Australia, is the jumping off point for many a Kimberley cruise, the likes of which boast full-on luxury in the form of sumptuous duvets, air-conditioned private cabins and fine dining. Yet I’d arrived determined to find a bargain, and thought I had – one that was a fraction of the price, if a bit rough and ready. However, as I’d just discovered, the upshot was that it also wasn’t fit for purpose, so here I was, up the coast without a vessel.</p></div>
