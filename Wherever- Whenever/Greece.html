  <p>Known for its history and archaic structures, Greece is also home to an abundance of culture beyond its capital. Explore the rural north or soak in the sun on the Aegean isles for an authentic experience</p>

  <p>Greece has a distinguished history to rival that of any country. During the classical age (6th-4th century BC) its scholars, philosophers and architects bestrode the world and built its wonders. A few millennia on, remarkable monuments fleck the Greek landscape like ancient confetti, each one capturing a different era or influence, from antiquity to the Byzantinenera (330-1453 AD) and beyond.</p>

  <p>These days, we're well versed in the ruins that liberally pepper cities like Thessaloniki and Athens. Yet head to the country's less-trod regions and islands, where age-old traditions and architecture still dominate, and there's just as much to discover. It's not all ancient relics, however, newer cultural experiences such as opera halls, theatres, museums and other cultural venues are gaining prominence, too. So whether you love roaming ruins or taking trips to the theatre, there's ample opportunity to delve into the bottomless well of Greek culture.</p></div>
