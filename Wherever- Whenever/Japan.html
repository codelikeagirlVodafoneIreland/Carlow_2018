  <p>Nowhere mixes the old and new quite like Japan – use modern trains to discover pilgrim paths, timeless peaks and glimpses into the past...</p>

  <p>The samurai was dancing. Well, not quite dancing, more jigging unconsciously, tapping his armour-clad leg to the beat of the wadaiko drums. And it wasn’t just the warrior who was stirred by the stomach-pounding beats.</p>

  <p>Here, beneath the ramparts of Matsumoto Castle, even the fort-like walls seemed to be shaking. I, too, was moved. Looking at the ornate fan-like gables of the thousand-year-old stronghold, listening to the ancient rhythm and watching the sky turn pink between the bare cherry branches, I felt like I’d been transported back in time.</p>

  <p>I had started my trip to Japan amid the bright modern lights of downtown Tokyo – where every shop, every sales person, every billboard vies for your attention – but after just a couple of hours on a bullet train, I found myself here, among the wider streets and lattice-wood-fronted shops of this eighth-century city. I’d arrived, by luck, on the night of Matsumoto’s annual Taiko Drum Festival, when troupes of youngsters battle it out on the skins in front of captivated crowds – something warriors would once have done to incite courage and strike fear into the enemy.</p>

  <p>This, one of the country’s best-preserved castles, was the perfect place to begin my search for the Japan of old, a time before the nation became defined by cutting-edge technology. But to delve deeper into the country’s past, I would need to lace up my walking boots and head for the hills. </p></div>
