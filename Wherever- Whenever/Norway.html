  <p>Tromsø, the self-styled ‘Capital of the Arctic’ is about more than the northern lights – expect humpback whales, epic mountains and lashings of Scandi cool...</p>

  <p>Tromsø’s natural gifts can seem almost unfair. Buried deep in the Arctic Circle in northern Norway, it’s surrounded by the soaring, skiiable peaks of the Lyngen Alps and fjords that draw pods of humpback whales in the winter. And, most famously, it’s slap-bang in the middle of the so-called Auroral Oval, the band of the Earth (between latitudes 65º and 70º north) in which the northern lights hit hardest and brightest.
  But what’s perhaps more surprising is that this city of just 76,000 residents, which lines two sides of a pretty fjord, is so culturally rich. Tromsø is steeped in the history of the area’s Sami reindeer herders, trappers and polar explorers, most notably Roald Amundsen, who took off from the city on his fateful final voyage in 1928. It’s little wonder that it was dubbed ‘the Paris of the North’ in the 19th century.</p></div>
