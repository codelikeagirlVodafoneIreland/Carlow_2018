        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Distracted Boyfriend, also known as Man Looking at Other Woman, is an object labeling stock photo series in which a man looks at the backside of a woman walking by while another woman, presumably his romantic partner, looks on disapprovingly.</p>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>On November 2, 2015, the source image, taken by photographer Antonio Guillem, was posted on the stock photo database iStock under the description "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl" (shown below, left).
          According to a post published on the Meme Documentation Tumblr blog, the earliest known captioned version of the photo was submitted to a Turkish Facebook group at an unknown date.
          On January 30th, 2017, the Prog Düşmanlarına Verilen Müthiş Cevaplar Facebook page posted the image with captions identifying the man as Phil Collins peering pop music while prog music looks on (shown below, right).</p>
        <p>The creator of Phil Collins meme has since stated that they were inspired by the political meme page "Siyasettin," who's earliest available version was posted on January 30th, 2017, as well.</p>
